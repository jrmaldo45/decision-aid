# Decision Aiding Tool
### Never struggle to choose a game again

A service to aid the user in choosing a game when uncertain.

Users can add games and game genres to separate lists and assign those genres to whatever game they would like. Once the "Pick a Game" button is pressed the application will then select a random game from the list and display it at the top of the page. The user can also choose to favorite games so that the list can be filtered down not only by genre but by favorite games as well.
