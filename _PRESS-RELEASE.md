There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Random Video Game Chooser

## Sub-Heading ##
  > For when gamers are struggling to pick a game from their immense library.

## Summary ##
  > Allows users to add games to a list of games that will expand as games are added. The user can then run the app and a random game will be chosen from the list of games provided by the user. Games can be added to different categories that are user created and can also be marked as a favorite. Doing so will give the user the option to narrow down the result of running this application based on what category the game is in or whether the game is marked as a favorite.

## Problem ##
  > It can be difficult to decide what game you want to play sometimes. Whether that is because there are too many options, or because a user is just unsure about what they want to play that day, this app aims to solve that problem.

## Solution ##
  > By allowing users to add their games to a list, the tough decision on what game to play can be given to the app instead. Occasionally a user may not know what game they want to play, but they might know what category or genre of game they want to play. In this case the user will be able to assign games different categories and have the app choose only from games that are within that category.

## Quote from You ##
  > As someone that plays many of videogames, I know how difficult it can be to choose a game to play, esspecially when there are so many options. Now that problem is a thing of the past.

## How to Get Started ##
  > This app is simple, all one must do to get started is add games to the list. Then click the "Choose a Game" button and that's it, game will be chosen from the list. Optionally the user can select a specific category to get a game from by selecting the desired category from the list above the "Choose a Game" button.

## Customer Quote ##
  > "This app is amazing! Gone are the days where I would just scroll through my game library instead of actually playing a game. Now I just hit a button and the game I am going to play is right there!"

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Stop staring at your games and start playing them with this handy helper.
